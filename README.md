My final fifth task as intern in PRODIGY INFOTECH.

Task about: Network packet analyzer.

Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzer network packet. Display relevant information's such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ensure the ethical us of the tool for educational purposes.

Features:

The program executes the sniffing of data packets by using internet. The program also lodes data to the packet then transfers the data packets to the destination by layer by layer using sniffer logarithm used in the code.

The program uses multiple protocols like TCP, UDP, ARP for transfer of packets. The program imports IP address liberators. The program reveres IP address of source and destination addresses of the transferred packet.

Output:

After the transfer of the packet the program display's the source IP address and Destination IP address, protocol used, packet transferred, and payload data details.
